# Welcome!

Here you will find information that
will help you to get started developing
the **_Tracery_** application. Tracery is a web
application implemented on the stack of
**_React + NestJS_**. The documentation covers both
back-end and front-end parts.

The documentation serves **_two main purposes_**:

1. Answer common questions arising during development
2. Document things that have already been implemented

The documentation tries to address the following
questions:

1. [Backend documentation](backend.md)
2. [Frontend documentation](frontend.md)

The information about application modules
can be found [here](modules.md).
