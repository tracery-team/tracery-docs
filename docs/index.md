# Welcome!

Here you will find information that
will help you to get started developing
the **_Tracery_** application. Tracery is a web
application implemented on the stack of
**_React + NestJS_**. The documentation covers both
back-end and front-end parts.

The documentation serves **_two main purposes_**:

1. Answer common questions arising during development
2. Document things that have already been implemented

The documentation tries to address the following
questions:

1. [How to write consistent code in general?](code-style.md)
2. [How do we collaborate together?](git-and-github.md)
3. [How to structure my code?](code-structure.md)
4. [How to use {...} library?](libraries.md)

The information about application modules 
can be found [here](modules.md).
